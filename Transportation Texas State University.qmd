abstract: The physical and social characteristics of university campuses provide a unique position for reducing transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions (@zhou2018). Travel behavior is influenced by both physical infrastructure and social factors, including personal perspectives, satisfaction, and attitudes, which determine commuters' mode choices (@deangelis2021). To efficiently reduce emissions from transportation, universities must capitalize on this crucial transition period when students show an increased likelihood of adopting sustainable travel behaviors (@deangelis2021). San Marcos, Texas, has a population of over 71,000 (@census2023) and is often recognized as a notable college town (@best390colleges2025). With a population of over 40,000, TXST students account for more than half of the local population. Breaking a 125-year record in the Fall of 2024, the TXST student population is increasing. San Marcos’ dense urban landscape and TXST’s compact campus create a distinct opportunity for employing and assessing novel transportation interventions. This project will provide a summary analysis of Texas State University students' travel behavior using parking survey data from the fall semester of 2024. The results of this analysis will provide insight leveraging campus characteristics and existing multi-modal systems to reduce transportation emissions. The contributions of this research will aid in future transportation planning and policy, particularly the implementation of the Texas State University 2025 Campus Master Plan.

## Introduction & Background

### Universities

#### Creating Demand

Universities campuses in college towns provide unique opportunities to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions other pollutants.
Interest in university student travel behavior has grown among researchers and policy makers and car dependency continues to adversely impact U.S. communities.
Universities are institutions that create awareness of climate change mitigation and sustainable transportation practices.

#### Travel Behavior

<<<<<<< HEAD
Theory of planned behavior suggest travel behavior are habits that are significant influenced by a commuters knowledge and perceptions of the local transportation system.
Travel behavior is understood to give insight to commuter belief and perspectives, and attitude towards travel options.
=======
The university is a "window of opportunity" for significant lifestyle changes, like travel behavior.
Travel behavior habits are repetitive decision made in a stable state of life based on the current knowledge and perspective of available resources.
Theory of planned behavior(TPB) suggest travel behavior are habits that are significant influenced by a commuters knowledge and perceptions of the available transportation system.
Travel behavior is understood to give insight to commuter belief and perspectives, and attitude towards travel modes.
>>>>>>> 73c7c9837b5e3834fe7b272b407fe22ca914da44
[@deangelis2012] used the Value-belief-norms(VBN) understand that an individuals moral obligation to the environment can significantly impact travel mode choice.
Understanding that habitual travel behavaiors are based on individual morals, explains how personal experiences and attitudes can shape travel mode choice.
A commuter's knowledge and perception of the available transportation modes will decide their travel behavior.

Study suggest habits are best broken and formed most easily during transitional period of life like have a child, relocating for a new job, or going to college.
During these transitional periods individuals are inevitably induced to new environments or experiences that may influence their perspectives and grow their knowledge base.
Changes adopted during this "window of opportunity" are likely to effect lifestyle choice like mode choice and last into later life beyond the university campus.
[@deangelis2012].
An commuters who uses alternative transportation option during college will view biking, walking, or public transit as favorable options later in life.
Where as someone who drive most of their time on campus is likely to continue with less chance of reconsidering other options.
[@okrazeska,] find that students are more likely than staff to choice alternative and active travel modes.
About 20% University staff preferred travel modes for their directness, duration, convenience and flexibility.
These travel preferences are consistent with staff demographics, representing a more stable consistent lifestyle, having dependents, and living away from campus.

#### Using Alternative Travel Modes

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Using Alternative Travel Modes

=======
>>>>>>> 73c7c9837b5e3834fe7b272b407fe22ca914da44
University students transient living and wide use to travel modes, marking them as notably from the general population.
University students are more likely to adopt alternative travel modes, having a higher portion versus staff and general public.
Students populations tend to walk and and bike more reducing car trips.
Student tend prioritize housing that is affordable and close to campus, providing them more travel mode choice.
The variety of quality transportation modes and high portion of alternative transportation modes creates a need for a more comprehensive transportation system, less reliant on fossil fuels.
Universities increase the demand on local transportation system while providing an opportunity to expand alternative transportation modes.
Today large university campuses are a microcosm of the urban landscape and provides a ideal environment for studying transportation policy and infrastructure.

### University Students Trip Generation

Universities are major contributors to commuting trips averaging 20% higher than the general public, **3.69** daily trips[@zhou2018, @khattak2011].
[@khattak2011] defines a trip as moving at least 300 feet from one address to another.
This definition is important for capturing travel behvior of university students living on or around campus.
Undergradute students living on campus make the most trips when compared to other university groups.
University students make shorter non-motorized trips, utilizing walking and biking infastructure.
[@khattak2011].

increasing demand for local transportation infrastructure As transportation cost and impact vary, there is a need for policy and infrastructure that encourages more sustainable transportation systems.

### Physical Environment & Urban Form

#### College Towns
>>>>>>> 73c7c9837b5e3834fe7b272b407fe22ca914da44

Universities or these cities within cities occupy large portions of the local area and population[@romanowska2019].
College towns are typically smaller in population and more compact with a median student population of 33%[@zhou2018].
A dense student population in a small town create opportunity to physical characteristics of campus to reduce adverse impacts from increasing transportation demand by promoting active and alternative travel.(p.15)

#### Travel Distance, Travel Time, Land Use, Transportation Planning, Density

[@romanowka2019, 15] identifies access to a vehicle, trip origin, and trip distance as key factors in travel mode choice.[@deangelis2021] finds locations and travel continuity as significantly impact mode choice.
The high density at Texas State increases potential for "transport infrastructure and services" supporting multi-modal travel.
Compact campus design promoted higher trip rates among students.
Higher density creates more complex transportation patterns.
May increase the importance of efficient multi-modal transportation systems.
High students density presents both challenges and opportunities for promoting alternative transportation.

Studies find that improved biking and pedestrian infrastructure reduces car commuting, to up 14%[@romanowka2019, 15].

University students live relatively close to campus and have accessible to quality multi-modal transportation systems[@zhou2018, 132]

For many the university campus is the A more rigorous focus on university travel will provide insight on how the built environment combined with social factors effect travel behavior[@deangelis2021].

#### Texas State University

Texas State University student population in the fall of 2024 accounted for over half the local population.
San Marcos, Texas, home to Texas State University (TXST), has a population exceeding 71,000 [@census2023].
As a college town, TXST itself hosts over 40,000 students, making it a significant contributor to local transportation patterns [@best390colleges2025].
TXST main campus is compact, with 259 building on 457 acre.[@UniversityMasterPlan]

This project aims to highlight the travel behavior of TXST students and explore opportunities for sustainable transportation improvements.
