An Assessment of Transportation at Texas State University

### 1. **Abstract**
The physical and social characteristics of university campuses provide a unique position for reducing transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions (@zhou2018). Travel behavior is influenced by both physical infrastructure and social factors, including personal perspectives, satisfaction, and attitudes, which determine commuters' mode choices (@deangelis2021). To efficiently reduce emissions from transportation, universities must capitalize on this crucial transition period when students show an increased likelihood of adopting sustainable travel behaviors (@deangelis2021).

San Marcos, Texas, has a population of over 71,000 (@census2023) and is often recognized as a notable college town (@best390colleges2025). With a population of over 40,000, TXST students account for more than half of the local population. Breaking a 125-year record in the Fall of 2024, the TXST student population is increasing. San Marcos’ dense urban landscape and TXST’s compact campus create a distinct opportunity for employing and assessing novel transportation interventions.

This project will provide a summary analysis of Texas State University students' travel behavior using parking survey data from the fall semester of 2024. The results of this analysis will provide insight leveraging campus characteristics and existing multimodal systems to reduce transportation emissions. The contributions of this research will aid in future transportation planning and policy, particularly the implementation of the Texas State University 2025 Campus Master Plan.


### 2. **Introduction & Background**

Universities campuses in college towns provide unique opportunities to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions other pollutants. College towns are small in population and more compact with a median student population of 33%(p.2) A population of students in a small town size combined with high student population create  opportunity to leverage physical and social characteristics of campus to reduce adverse impacts from increasing transportation demand by promoting active and alternative travel.(p.15) Universities and college towns can benefit from utilizing a Travel Demand Management strategy. Universities, such as ULCA, that have historically employed a Travel Demand Management strategies provide good examples.

Texas State University student population in the fall of 2024 accounted for over half the local population. San Marcos, Texas, home to Texas State University (TXST), has a population exceeding 71,000 (@census2023). As a college town, TXST itself hosts over 40,000 students, making it a significant contributor to local transportation patterns (@best390colleges2025). TXST main campus is compact, with **259** building on 457 acre.(University Master Plan, )

### Transportation Planning Implications:
"Location and connectivity" significantly impact mode choice. 
(@deangelis2021)
**The high density at Texas State suggests:**
- Increased potential for "transport infrastructure and services" supporting multimodal travel
- Similar to findings where compact campus design promoted higher trip rates among students.
- **Higher density** likely creates more complex transportation patterns
	- May increase the importance of efficient multimodal transportation options
	- Could present both challenges and opportunities for promoting non-motorized transportation
This project aims to highlight the travel behavior of TXST students and explore opportunities for sustainable transportation improvements.
