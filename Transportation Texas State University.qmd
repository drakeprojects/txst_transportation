## Introduction & Background

### Universities

#### Creating Demand

Universities campuses in college towns provide unique opportunities to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions(GHGe) other pollutants. Interest in university student travel behavior has grown among researchers and policy makers and car dependency continues to adversely impact U.S. communities[@zhou2018][@kattak2011]. Car dependency contunies to have adverse environmental, social and economic consequenses on communitities. including pollution, health effects, and finiancial burden[@romanowska2019]. Universities are recongnized institutions that create awareness of climate change mitigation and sustainable transportation practices[@romanowsaka2019][@deangelis2021][@zhou2012].

Referred to as "cities inside cities" . universities are ideal learning laboratories for researching and identifying sustainability initiatives. Operating as a communal network that reflects a large community and function universities have a significant role in promoting sustainable development and tackling transportation concerns. The movement of students, students staff and visitors is a critical factor in the growing impact of universities campuses to the surrounding area. Universities have a large footprint, accounting for up to 2% of the total annual U.S. GHGe, making it important that they participate in mitigating climate change[@parsley2022].

University students are considered a key segment of the population those travel is often understudies and weakly covered in current literature and data collection[@kattak2011][@taylor2021]. Current research explores daily commuting patterns, factors influencing travel behavior, and the potential for shifting toward more sustainable travel modes[@romanowska2019][@zhou2011].Factors affecting mode choice include physical environment(distance, time, density), mode-specific cost, accessibility to transit, personal attributes, trip charateristics, travel demand management (TDM) measures, and psychological factors( or awareness and previewed safety[@zhou2018].

Using Alternative Travel Modes

University students transient living and wide use to travel modes, marking them as notably from the general population. University students are more likely to adopt alternative travel modes, having a higher portion versus staff and general public. Students populations tend to walk and and bike more reducing car trips. Student tend prioritize housing that is affordable and close to campus, providing them more travel mode choice. The variety of quality transportation modes and high portion of alternative transportation modes creates a need for a more comprehensive transportation system, less reliant on fossil fuels. Universities increase the demand on local transportation system while providing an opportunity to expand alternative transportation modes. Today large university campuses are a microcosm of the urban landscape and provides a ideal environment for studying transportation policy and infrastructure. [@zhou2018, 133]

College towns are recognized as areas where university students account for a significant share of the local population(33% or more) and tend to have smaller population sizes and a more compact urban form compared to large urban areas[@zhou2018]. This compactness suggest students are more likely to walk or bike and drive less[@zhou2018]. A study focused on college students commuter students were more likely to use alternative and active travel modes when compared to staff and peers at urban universities[@zhou2018]. However, 25% of commuters students living within two miles of campus drove alone, indicating that a compact form is only the only factor of satisfying all travel needs, like out of town travel[@zhou2018]. The advantage of shorter distances, good transit, and a safe environment are not guarantees of alternative mode, suggesting the need for further strategies to manage transportation needs[@zhou2018].

University Students Trip Generation

Universities are major contributors to commuting trips averaging 20% higher than the general public, **3.69** daily trips[@zhou2018, @khattak2011]. [@khattak2011] defines a trip as moving at least 300 feet from one address to another. This definition is important for capturing travel behavior of university students living on and around campus. Undergraduate students living on campus make the most trips when compared to other university groups. University students make shorter non-motorized trips, utilizing walking and biking infrastructure. [@khattak2011].

Increasing demand for local transportation infrastructure As transportation cost and impact vary, there is a need for policy and infrastructure that encourages more sustainable transportation systems.

Travel Distance, Travel Time, Land Use, Transportation Planning, Density(compactness)

[@romanowka2019, 15] identifies access to a vehicle, trip origin, and trip distance as key factors in travel mode choice.[@deangelis2021] finds locations and travel continuity as significantly impact mode choice. The high density at Texas State increases potential for "transport infrastructure and services" supporting multi-modal travel. Compact campus design promoted higher trip rates among students. Higher density creates more complex transportation patterns. May increase the importance of efficient multi-modal transportation systems. High students density presents both challenges and opportunities for promoting alternative transportation.

Studies find that improved biking and pedestrian infrastructure reduces car commuting, to up 14%[@romanowka2019, 15].

University students live relatively close to campus and have accessible to quality multi-modal transportation systems[@zhou2018, 132]

For many the university campus is the A more rigorous focus on university travel will provide insight on how the built environment combined with social factors effect travel behavior[@deangelis2021].

Universities are active;ly encouraging sustainable education and practices[@parsley]. Students are a social group with high willingness to adopt new ideas and make lifestyle changes. The knowledge, experences, and attitudes gain during college raise awareness in for the wider public[@romanowska2019]. Universities can leverage this to promote pro-environmental values and prevent the development of pro-car habits in young commuters[@deangelis2021].

Window of Oppurtunity

The university is a "window of opportunity" for significant lifestyle changes, like travel behavior. Travel behavior habits are repetitive decision made in a stable state of life based on the current knowledge and perspective of available resources. Theory of planned behavior(TPB) suggest travel behavior are habits that are significant influenced by a commuters knowledge and perceptions of the available transportation system. Travel behavior is understood to give insight to commuter belief and perspectives, and attitude towards travel modes. [@deangelis2012] used the Value-belief-norms(VBN) understand that an individuals moral obligation to the environment can significantly impact travel mode choice. Understanding that habitual travel behaviors are based on individual morals, explains how personal experiences and attitudes can shape travel mode choice. A commuter's knowledge and perception of the available transportation modes will decide their travel behavior.

Study suggest habits are best broken and formed most easily during transitional period of life like have a child, relocating for a new job, or going to college. During these transitional periods individuals are inevitably induced to new environments or experiences that may influence their perspectives and grow their knowledge base. Changes adopted during this "window of opportunity" are likely to effect lifestyle choice like mode choice and last into later life beyond the university campus. [@deangelis2012]. An commuters who uses alternative transportation option during college will view biking, walking, or public transit as favorable options later in life. Where as someone who drive most of their time on campus is likely to continue with less chance of reconsidering other options. [@okrazeska,] find that students are more likely than staff to choice alternative and active travel modes. About 20% University staff preferred travel modes for their directness, duration, convenience and flexibility. These travel preferences are consistent with staff demographics, representing a more stable consistent lifestyle, having dependents, and living away from campus.

#### Texas State University

Texas State University student population in the fall of 2024 accounted for over half the local population. San Marcos, Texas, home to Texas State University (TXST), has a population exceeding 71,000 [@census2023]. As a college town, TXST itself hosts over 40,000 students, making it a significant contributor to local transportation patterns [@best390colleges2025]. TXST main campus is compact, with 259 building on 457 acre.[@UniversityMasterPlan]

This project aims to highlight the travel behavior of TXST students and explore opportunities for sustainable transportation improvements.
