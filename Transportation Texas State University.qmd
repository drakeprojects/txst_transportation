abstract: The physical and social characteristics of university campuses provide a unique position for reducing transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions (@zhou2018).
Travel behavior is influenced by both physical infrastructure and social factors, including personal perspectives, satisfaction, and attitudes, which determine commuters' mode choices (@deangelis2021).
To efficiently reduce emissions from transportation, universities must capitalize on this crucial transition period when students show an increased likelihood of adopting sustainable travel behaviors (@deangelis2021).
San Marcos, Texas, has a population of over 71,000 (@census2023) and is often recognized as a notable college town (@best390colleges2025).
With a population of over 40,000, TXST students account for more than half of the local population.
Breaking a 125-year record in the Fall of 2024, the TXST student population is increasing.
San Marcos’ dense urban landscape and TXST’s compact campus create a distinct opportunity for employing and assessing novel transportation interventions.
This project will provide a summary analysis of Texas State University students' travel behavior using parking survey data from the fall semester of 2024.
The results of this analysis will provide insight leveraging campus characteristics and existing multi-modal systems to reduce transportation emissions.
The contributions of this research will aid in future transportation planning and policy, particularly the implementation of the Texas State University 2025 Campus Master Plan.

### Background

Creating Demand

Universities campuses in college towns provide unique opportunities to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions other pollutants. Interest in university student travel behavior has grown among researchers and policy makers and car depedency continues to adversly impact U.S. communities.

Universities or these cities within cities occupy large portions of the local area and population[@romanowska2019, 2]. Universities are in a pivotal position to encourage more sustainable transportation practices and guide future discussions in the field of climate mitigation. Universities understand their far beyond campus grounds and graduation. As students scatter and joining the workforce they take the habits and lifestyle changes adopted during their time in HEI. This "window of opportunity", time of much change, the time spend in college is a crucial time of development habits and adopting new lifestyle changes. Much like having a baby, moving cities, or joining the military, going to college is a time people are more likely to introduce new habits and routines into their lives. [@romanowska2019, 3].

University students transient living and wide use to travel modes, mark them as notably from the general population. Universities are major contributors to commuting trips, increasing demand for local transportation infrastructure[@zhou2018, 132]. As transportation cost and impact vary, there is a need for policy and infrastructure that encourages more sustainable transportation systems. University students are often have a higher portion using alternative travel modes. University students live relatively close to campus and have accessible to quality multi-modal transportation systems[@zhou2018, 132].The variety of quality transportation modes and high portion of alternative transportation modes creates a need for a more comprehensive transportation system, less reliant on fossil fuels. Universities increase the demand on local transportation system while providing an opportunty to expand alternative transportation modes. Today large university campuses are a microcosm of the urban landscape and provides a ideal environment for studying transportation policy and infrastructure. [@zhou2018, 133]

Physical Environment & Urban Form

Travel Distance, Travel Time, Land Use, Transportation Planning, Density

"Location and connectivity" significantly impact mode choice. (@deangelis2021) The high density at Texas State increases potential for "transport infrastructure and services" supporting multi-modal travel. Similar to findings where compact campus design promoted higher trip rates among students. Higher density creates more complex transportation patterns - May increase the importance of efficient multi-modal transportation options - Could present both challenges and opportunities for promoting non-motorized transportation This project aims to highlight the travel behavior of TXST students and explore opportunities for sustainable transportation improvements.

College towns are small in population and more compact with a median student population of 33%[@zhou2018] A population of students in a small town size combined with high student population create opportunity to leverage physical and social characteristics of campus to reduce adverse impacts from increasing transportation demand by promoting active and alternative travel.(p.15)

Texas State University student population in the fall of 2024 accounted for over half the local population. San Marcos, Texas, home to Texas State University (TXST), has a population exceeding 71,000 (@census2023). As a college town, TXST itself hosts over 40,000 students, making it a significant contributor to local transportation patterns (@best390colleges2025). TXST main campus is compact, with **259** building on 457 acre.(University Master Plan, )

### Transportation Planning Implications:

### Objectives

-   Analyze transportation and travel behavior of Texas State University students using parking survey data from the Fall 2024 semester.
-   Identify trends and areas for improvement in campus transportation.
-   Provide actionable recommendations to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions.

### Methodology

-   Data Collection: Utilize parking survey data from Fall 2024.
-   Analysis:
    -   Perform statistical summary analysis of travel behavior based on survey responses.
    -   Identify key insights related to transportation patterns.
    -   Examine the potential impact of changes in travel behavior on greenhouse gas emissions.
-   Summary and Recommendations:
    -   Draft a summary analysis of the findings.
    -   Propose actionable steps for TXST to promote sustainable transportation.
