# Introduction & Background

## Universities

### Creating Demand

Universities campuses in college towns provide unique opportunities to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions(GHGe) and other pollutants.
Interest in university student travel behavior has grown among researchers and policy makers as car dependency continues to adversely impact U.S. communities[@zhou2018][@khattak2011].
The adverse effects of car dependency include pollution, health effects, and financial burden[@romanowska2019].
Universities are recognized institutions that can create awareness of climate change mitigation and sustainable transportation practices[@romanowska2019][@deangelis2021][@zhou2012].

Referred to as "cities inside cities"universities are ideal learning laboratories for researching and identifying sustainability initiatives.
Functioning as a large communal network that reflects a large community and function universities have a significant role in promoting sustainable development and tackling transportation concerns.
The movement of students, staff and visitors is a critical factor in the growing impact of universities campuses to the surrounding area.
Universities have a large footprint, accounting for up to 2% of the total annual U.S.GHGe, making it important that they participate in reducing adverse impacts[@parsley2022].

Today large university campuses are a microcosm of the urban landscape and provides a ideal environment for studying transportation policy and infrastructure.
[@zhou2018, 133]

University students are considered a key segment of the population those travel is often understudies and weakly covered in current literature and data collection[@kattak2011][@taylor2021].
Current research explores daily commuting patterns, factors influencing travel behavior, and the potential for shifting toward more sustainable travel modes[@romanowska2019][@zhou2011].

### Trip Generation

Universities are major contributors to commuting trips averaging 20% higher than the general public, **3.69** daily trips[@zhou2018, @khattak2011].
Universities serve a large number of students and staff forming a significant portion of the local or regional population[@romanowska2019].
This large populations moving from and around a compact campus inherently generate a significant volume of daily trips[@romanowska2019].
[@khattak2011] defines a trip as moving at least 300 feet from one address to another.
This definition helps capture travel behavior of university students move around campus that tends to be a shorter distance[]. University students make shorter non-motorized trips, utilizing walking and biking infrastructure.
[@khattak2011].
Undergraduate students living on campus make the most trips when compared to other university groups[].


### Using Alternative Travel Modes

University students are more transient living and are more likely to use alternative travel modes, marking them as notably from the general population.
University students are more likely to adopt alternative travel modes, having a higher portion walking or biking when compared to staff and general public.
Student tend prioritize housing that is affordable and close to campus, providing them more travel mode choice.
The variety of quality transportation modes anddemand for alternative transportation modes creates a need for a more comprehensive transportation system, less reliant on single occupancy vehicle travel[].
Universities increase the demand on local transportation system while providing an opportunity to expand alternative transportation modes.

The compactness of campus encourages students to use walk or bike and drive less[@zhou2018].
A study focused on college students commuter students were more likely to use alternative and active travel modes when compared to staff and peers at urban universities[@zhou2018].
However, 25% of commuters students living within two miles of campus drove alone, indicating that a compact form is only the only factor of satisfying all travel needs, like out of town travel[@zhou2018].
The advantage of shorter distances, good transit, and a safe environment are not guarantees of alternative mode, suggesting the need for further strategies to manage transportation needs[@zhou2018].

[@romanowka2019, 15] identifies access to a vehicle, trip origin, and trip distance as key factors in travel mode choice.[@deangelis2021] finds locations and travel continuity as significantly impact mode choice.
The high density at Texas State increases potential for "transport infrastructure and services" supporting multi-modal travel.
Compact campus design promoted higher trip rates among students.
Higher density creates more complex transportation patterns.
May increase the importance of efficient multi-modal transportation systems.
High students density presents both challenges and opportunities for promoting alternative transportation.
Studies find that improved biking and pedestrian infrastructure reduces car commuting, to up 14%[@romanowka2019, 15].
University students live relatively close to campus and have accessible to quality multi-modal transportation systems[@zhou2018, 132]

### Window of Opportunity

For many the university campus is the A more rigorous focus on university travel will provide insight on how the built environment combined with social factors effect travel behavior[@deangelis2021].
Universities are active;ly encouraging sustainable education and practices[@parsley].
Students are a social group with high willingness to adopt new ideas and make lifestyle changes.
The knowledge, experiences, and attitudes gain during college raise awareness in for the wider public[@romanowska2019].
Universities can leverage this to promote pro-environmental values and prevent the development of pro-car habits in young commuters[@deangelis2021].

The university is a "window of opportunity" for significant lifestyle changes, like travel behavior.
Travel behavior habits are repetitive decision made in a stable state of life based on the current knowledge and perspective of available resources.
Theory of planned behavior(TPB) suggest travel behavior are habits that are significant influenced by a commuters knowledge and perceptions of the available transportation system.
Travel behavior is understood to give insight to commuter belief and perspectives, and attitude towards travel modes.
[@deangelis2012] used the Value-belief-norms(VBN) understand that an individuals moral obligation to the environment can significantly impact travel mode choice.
Understanding that habitual travel behaviors are based on individual morals, explains how personal experiences and attitudes can shape travel mode choice.
A commuter's knowledge and perception of the available transportation modes will decide their travel behavior.

Study suggest habits are best broken and formed most easily during transitional period of life like have a child, relocating for a new job, or going to college.
During these transitional periods individuals are inevitably induced to new environments or experiences that may influence their perspectives and grow their knowledge base.
Changes adopted during this "window of opportunity" are likely to effect lifestyle choice like mode choice and last into later life beyond the university campus.
[@deangelis2012].
An commuters who uses alternative transportation option during college will view biking, walking, or public transit as favorable options later in life.
Where as someone who drive most of their time on campus is likely to continue with less chance of reconsidering other options.
[@okrazeska,] find that students are more likely than staff to choice alternative and active travel modes.
About 20% University staff preferred travel modes for their directness, duration, convenience and flexibility.
These travel preferences are consistent with staff demographics, representing a more stable consistent lifestyle, having dependents, and living away from campus.

### Research Question

How can universities leverage physical factors of campus to reduce transportation emissions?

## Methodology

This study site is Texas State University(TXST), a premier public school institution located in San Marcos Texas.
As one of seven institutions in The Texas State University System, San Marcos(main) campus serves 40,678 students today.
TXST is strategically located in the Texas Triangle, the dynamic regions of Texas that encompasses San Antonio, Austin, Dallas-Forth Worth, and Houston[@txcampplan24].
This area is home to more than 70% of Texas population(\>21 million people).
The San Marcos campus itself is a characterized by its size, unique topography, and integration with significant natural features like the San Marcos River.
The local transportation environment includes a pedestrian-centric core, existing parking infrastructure, and congested roadways challenges.
This research focuses on understanding how to further leverage physical features of campus to reduce transportation emissions by investigating TXST students travel behavior using parking survey data.

This research will utilize Texas State University Campus Master Plans 2017-2027 and 2025-2035, sourced from the The Texas State University System website.
Both master plans give updates on implementations from previous campus master plans and a roadmap for the next decade.
These campus master plans inform stakeholders to include campus population, student, faculty, staff and the local community.
The plans give updates on progress on objective such enrollment rates and usable square footage reports.
They also includes infrastructure plans, such as renovations and build project, and overall campus design direction for architecture and transportation.

TXST Parking Survey Spring 2024 data for a quantitative analysis of university student travel.
This annual parking survey questionnaire was developed by the using Quadratics and administrator via university emails to all TXST students.
This survey is used to gathering comprehensive information regarding students' daily commuting patterns during the 2023-2024 Spring semester.
This survey received (1,182/40678), responses rate of 2.9%(0.02908).
According to survey found in the literature review, this is a reasonable rate for a commute survey.
The data collected from the student responses is a quantitative in nature and will be used for a statistical summary analysis of travel behavior.

This study will investigate travel behavior and travel characteristics of students at TXST of travel around campus.
Alternative travel modes include university(Bobcat Shuttle), city(CARTS), and private apartment shuttles, walk, bicycle, carpool, drop-off, ride-share(Uber/Lyft), and micro-mobility(SPIN scooters).
Students received no incentives for completing the survey.

Identify key insights related to transportation patterns:

-   Primary travel mode
-   Frequency of travel
-   Trip distance and length
-   Parking permit ownership
-   Private vehicle access
-   Examine the potential impact of changes in travel behavior on greenhouse gas emissions.

### Objectives

-   Analyze transportation and travel behavior of Texas State University students using parking survey data from the Fall 2024 semester.

-   Identify trends and areas for improvement in campus transportation planning using 2025-2035 Campus Master Plans.

-   Provide actionable recommendations to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions.

## Conclusion

This research proposal addresses a critical intersection between higher education and environmental sustainability by examining transportation patterns at Texas State University.
As universitiespopulations and commuter trips grow commuting, understanding student travel behavior represents a significant opportunity for climate impact reduction. The proposed study leverages Texas State University's unique position as a "city within a city" and capitalizes on the "window of opportunity" that university life presents for establishing sustainable travel habits.

The compact nature of university campuses, combined with students' demonstrated willingness to adopt alternative transportation modes, creates an ideal environment for testing and implementing sustainable transportation strategies. The findings from this study benefit TXST's sustainability goals and contribute to the broader understanding of how universities can serve as living laboratories for sustainable transportation policy and infrastructure development.

By analyzing 2017-2027 planning with the implementation plans and current conditions of the university in 2025-2035 Campus Master Plan, this research will provide evidence-based insights into how physical campus design influences student travel choices and emission patterns.

By identifying specific physical and policy interventions that effectively reduce transportation emissions, this study will provide a repeatable model for other universities seeking to minimize their environmental impact while serving their communities more effectively.

The expected outcomes are to enhance understanding of student travel behavior by identifing key influencing factors, and actionable recommendations, this study will position Texas State University as a leader in sustainable campus transportation planning.
