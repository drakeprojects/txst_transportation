Parking services become not an auxillary service, if there are going to be that many students, faculty, and staff then there should be adequate parking for all of those who are paying to utilize the services. An even distributiOn of parking spaces for the different parking based On the amount of passes sold and purchased by those utilizing the services would allow for improvements to be made by lowering the pass prices so that they are more affordable for those trying to find a place to park so they can get to class. Meaning more purple parking and more green parking or just have student parking and faculty parking so that more student can purchase them giving the parking services more mOney to make the necessary changes required to benefit the school and the students.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1/9/24
To the parking supervisor,

I went to Kellem building 1/9/24 to pay my EIGHT THOUSAND dollar tuitiOn and there were no visitor parking spots available. 
Lisa, sent me and my mom to the garage and we had to pay for parking. We would like reimbursement for the fact that you have NO visitor spots available. It’s $3, but the principal of the matter is that Lisa(she wouldn’t give us her last name, and she was very unpleasant to us) let another mother and her daughter park in the parking lot and not me and my mom. We literally heard and witnessed her give them a temporary pass and deny us. Neither the mom and her daughter had a red pass in their possessiOn. I have a parking pass, but was in a different vehicle, just as the other family had stated. We heard and witnessed them say the same thing as we did, which was that we aren’t in the vehicle that was registered with the pass. It was an empty campus, no school in sessiOn, no teachers back. It was a ghost town. Plenty of “special guest parking” which is what she called the open visitor parking. 

I’d like to be reimbursed for the parking, as your lot had failed to provide parking for visitors. There was a spot open, but Lisa wouldn’t let us park in the visitor spot. I’m disappointed in the way she treated us, versus how she treated the other family. 
She was extremely rude. Told us things like “dOn’t worry about them, worry about yourself”, “how would I even know if you are student here”, and “those visitor spots are reserved for special guests”. 
It hOnestly felt very discriminating, what made my mom and I different then the other mom and daughter? My mom and I were both extremely uncomfortable. My mom, a proud TxState Alumni, was so embarrassed and disappointed. It hOnestly ruined both our day  We had no desire to walk the campus and reminisce On the good times she recalled. 
It was a horrible experience and we are extremely disappointed that this is a persOn chosen to represent Texas State. 

I had emailed Once before, hadn’t received a respOnse. I didn’t feel as if including our feelings towards the matter was appropriate for the audience the parking staff could possibly reach, so I’m reaching out to you, the supervisor, in private.

No where On this survey was there an optiOn to rate how difficult/ easy it is to find a parking space of the zOne you purchase.

The perimeter spaces that are available are extremely far from classes and could warrant just parking somewhere for free, without paying for a permit, then ride the bus. 
Riding is bud is way quicker than perimeter parking. Perimeter parking is a joke and a scam.

Also, If students are handicapped, you need to give them a handicapped space. Not a red space.
I broke my feet this year and was Only given a red temp tag to accommodate. There were no available red spots by my classes. So I was forced to miss many classes because of a failure to accommodate from the Peking services.

I find it absurd that after spending almost an hour commuting 33 miles One way to campus I must wait for a shuttle which does not run On cOnsistent timings, sometimes waiting almost half an hour for a bus ride that is Only a few miles. I find it more absurd to see open parking spots that are not being utilized and are being kept open for a group of people who have the lowest likely need to have cars, since all of their needs are within walking distance. I find it ridiculous that parking services, which must pay for itself as I am reminded by this questiOn, does not take advantage of the opportunity to upgrade parking passes for students willing to pay an additiOnal cost.
Reduce the number of green spots and/or allow purple passes to be upgraded for a fee after the school year begins (give priority queue for purchase to better students or needs based).

Parking there has always been difficult, but since the third row of Speck that was originally purple parking has been replaced with green parking, it has become more frustrating to find a spot. It’s annoying checking that last purple ramp, just to drive up to see a floor for green passes be empty, and parking there will result in a ticket. Having that third floor for purple permits gave more of an opportunity  for an available spot in a timely manner compared to the two floors and a ramp we have been given for the 2023-2024 academic year. It’s unfair to take parking away from those who had already purchased a parking permit. Students who have purchased permits should ALWAYS have an available spot to park in. 
James Street Lot (C12) doesn’t exist anymore due to whatever building is being placed there now, and so people who parked there, now park at Speck, making it even harder to find a spot at Speck.
Back to replacing purple parking with green parking, why make the entirety of Academy Street Garage (304) green, when just a year ago the first level of that garage was for purple parking permits, and that was taken away too. Academy Street Garage doesn’t even get completely filled with the residential parking so why take it away from people with the purple parking in the first place?
For every parking garage across campus: Can a vehicle size limit be placed? Students with comedically large trucks or vans need to park at the stadium, because accidents are bound to happen. These large vehicles stick halfway out the parking spots, even if the back of the vehicle is against the wall. 
Can there be more cameras placed? Students are speeding through these garages and I’ve had my car damaged On plenty of occasiOns but nothing to help me see what happened or who did the damage.
-
Notes about who is parking in Speck: dOn’t y’all have your own parking area in Matthew’s St. Garage (R46)? Why are there two parking services cars parked in Speck? That’s taking away two spots a student could’ve parked in to be at class in time, but they’re taken by two TXST vehicles that should be parked where the other cars are at, instead of screwing over students who have been circling, wasting gas, for a spot. &lt; same exact reasOning for that row of red parking taking up the entire wall On the 2nd level of Speck. The new police building has a parking lot, but student parking was STILL taken away for campus police workers.
-
Idea for garage: maybe a gate could be placed, like at LBJ and Edward Gary St. Garage, at Speck, so students who have purchased a permit can scan their license plate or TXST ID and be allowed in. However , those who dOn’t have a valid parking pass aren’t allowed through.

Attempting to park at UEC is pointless unless you intend On walking the distance to campus, as the Bobcat Village shuttle is already full when it gets to the UEC bus stop. This leaves the Only optiOn for commuter perimeter parking at Bobcat Stadium, and although the shuttle for this stop works well and is frequent, students like myself with late classes often miss the last bus. Due to its distance from campus and lack of safe walkways, especially late at night, it makes this spot inefficient. I can Only find a spot at Specks when I arrive On campus at or before 7:30 AM. Please, repurpose some of the green and red restricted spaces to purple spaces On campus, Offer a better shuttle alternative for the UEC lot, and work to promote Nite Cats.

There also needs to be more buses On the routes to commuter parking, specifically Bobcat Village. Often the buses are overfull and/or the buses get grouped up On One side of the route or the other. 

Buses come infrequently, especially towards the beginning of the semester and I have often waited almost 40 minutes at Bobcat Village during the middle of the school day and there is not a train that has blocked the route.

AdditiOnally, there needs to either be two night bus routes or at least another bus On the nightroute. I have often waited close to an hour for the bus to stop at LBJ after class, and the route then takes up to thirty minutes to get to Bobcat Village.

Please stop taking parking spots in garages away from commuter parking; there needs to be a lot more parking available for commuters as a lot of the students are commuters. Instead, since the time I've started coming here parking spots are taken away from commuters who have to park to get to campus and given to On campus residents who dOn't need to drive daily. Not Only does this increase the overall commute to the school, it also increases safety issues within the Speck parking garage (the Only parking available close enough to campus to walk that is now available to commuters!!!!). Today while trying to find a spot I was almost hit head On by a number of other students speeding through the garage trying to find One of the almost impossible to find parking spots in there, and this is normal for that garage.

I really dOn't see why On-campus residents are given preference for parking when they dOn't have to drive every day to get to school - instead, commuters - who make up a large populatiOn of the student body solely based On the amount of cars parked near the stadium and in Bobcat village - are absolutely shafted when it comes to parking optiOns and bus availability.",Detractor,1,Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,Extremely easy,Somewhat dissatisfied,Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,Extremely dissatisfied,Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,,,,

The least that could be dOne is have a fee for parking or the right thing is just receive the amount necessary to accommodate parking. Eventually, Texas State will end up like UT and be overcrowded with insane parking issues, because they stopped short of trying to fix the issue. My optimistic suggestiOn would be to buy land near the highway and have a big commuter/anyOne parking lot with a tram that takes you into Texas State and reduces city traffic. More reasOnable tear down Elliott Hall and turn it into a larger faculty (red) parking. Then add One or two levels to woods parking garage and make it a commuter parking lot. Lastly, I'd open up some of the remaining open red lots around Ingram and McCoy to resident parking, because the ""Elliott Hall"" parking garage would accommodate staff. My last cOntingency would be to cOntinue adding parking garage On the north side of Texas State Campus, south of Sessom Dr. My list of ideas could probably go On and On, but doing nothing is absolutely dissatisfying and potentially could be a bigger issue as attendance rates cOntinue to rise.",Detractor,2,Somewhat dissatisfied,Neither easy nor difficult,Extremely satisfied,Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,Extremely satisfied,Somewhat satisfied,,,,

Bobcat stadium is not an acceptable optiOn. I would have to leave over 2 hours in advance for a class that lasts an hour 20.

I also feel that the ideal of our mOney being allotted to building new garages and repaving lots is interesting. Because there has not been a new lot or a repaving dOne for any commuter lots in the past 2 years. I believe that commuters should be taken more seriously and given better cOnditiOns seeing as Only freshman are allowed to be housed On campus. I think that the freshman should have to park and leave their cars in the lots farther away from campus, which would allow commuters to park closer seeing as they drive more often and farther distances weekly than the average freshman. The last point Id like to make is that the use of the UEC parking lot (lot 5) for tailgating is inappropriate because the preparatiOns begin On Friday, taking up more than half of the lot space away from commuters. thanks for your time",Detractor,2,Somewhat dissatisfied,Neither easy nor difficult,Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,Extremely dissatisfied,Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,,,LBJ,

I didn't even know where the parking service Office was. you guys got at least 300 dollars from me in parking tickets before realized the advice given to me through the parking services email was wrOng. I was told to apply for a green pass ($400 for a 4-week semester) while I was waiting to get approved for a green parking pass I was slapped with at least two more tickets. i had to figure out On my own that the Only way to really buy a pass at that point was the weekly pass and whenever I'd forget to renew it right On time id get another ticket. I didn't know i could appeal a ticket, I most certainly would have. There needs to be some kind of informatiOnal thing for transfer students starting in the summer. Also stop over-selling passes, During my year in the dorm I felt like i could never leave in my car because there would be NO PARKING available in the lot i paid almost $500 to park in. Its important that there are more reliable transportatiOn methods if you can't sustain the student body you are indebting your services to. I dOn't see how you can build more parking- you should probably tell the incoming freshman class that there is limited parking. the school would also greatly benefit from more busses, especially On the commuter route which always crowded and the busses take forever. In the quad, there is also a sidewalk that ends causing people who need to cross to do it illegally. There is no way to really fix that but could you put a pedestrian crossing sign up? I'm very surprised no One has been seriously injured. Fines dOn't need to be $45,  that's insane. When I was in the dorm i remember driving around for up to an hour in the parking garage looking for available parking, waiting for someOne to leave. If I worked late nights id be completely screwed and be forced to park in the small parking lot by the health center, and id most definitely get a ticket. There needs to be more parking for people with green passes if you're going to keep overselling. Mabye you should think about cOnverting a dorm into a parking garage and also making all the students sleep in their cars for 5k a semester. Just selling the green passes alOne would generate a enormous amount of profit that could be put towards reinforcing the roads and possibly building more parking. Or just letting people use the parking lots that are always empty.",,,,,,,,,,,,
